If you don't live around the upstate area, thats okay! Manhattan is the best of the both worlds from the luminous, bustling streets overshadowed by the cloud-cutting skyscrapers, to the beautiful, gigantic scenery of Grand Central Park! </p>

<h2> My Hobbies! </h2>

 <p = style = "font-size: 18px;"> One of the things I love to do most is to draw! Everyday and every chance I get, I will drawing anything, even if its a simple doodle. Drawing has been a major pastime for me since middle school and it has consumed most of my free time since then. I enjoy drawing a lot because i enjoy hobbies where I can create things so it serves as an outlet for me to express my creativity and ideas to draw into existence. Aside from that, I also find it therapeutic because drawing is a very passive pasttime, so it tends to relax me, especially during a calm night within the comfort of my own house. I have a predilection for drawing cartoons and I look forward to implementing my own art skills into Computer Science! </p>
