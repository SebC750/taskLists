   <p style = "font-size: 18px"> NY is my state and NYC is my city! Since day 1, I have always called NYC home. There is so much to do and so many places to visit that are all packed within five bouroughs! Even outside of that, there is the cold and breezing rural landscapes of upstate New York too! If you don't live around the upstate area, thats okay! Manhattan is the best of the both worlds from the luminous, bustling streets overshadowed by the cloud-cutting skyscrapers, to the beautiful, gigantic scenery of Grand Central Park! </p>
