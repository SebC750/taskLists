   <td> Since freshman year of college, I have been learning basics for java coding, such as UML, wrapper classes, edge detection etc. In the spring semester of my freshman year, i moved on towards working on handling data from files and reorganizing them, calculating the min/max/average/highest/lowest values for stock data extracted from a .csv file, using hierarchy to determine how a wage or a salary should be calculated for an employee and creating a probability dice program. </td>

   <td> In the fall semester of sophomore year, I spent a semester working with MySQl to develop databases. Throughout the entire semester, I worked with my partner to develop a School Health Database which was a database designed to hold information about students and the information filled out in their health exam sheets. Information for documents such as the School Tally Sheet and the Immunization records for students are derived from information filled out in the Health Exam form. </td>

I'm still learning how to work with css in order to create appealing graphic designs for websites by creating test projects where I explore the inner workings of the framework. </td>
